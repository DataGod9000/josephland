# Joseph's 2D game portfolio

2D portfolio/game (Kaboom.js): explore a room, click to move, interact with objects.

## Run the 2D game

From the project root:

```bash
npm run game
```

(First time: `cd game` then `npm install`, then run `npm run game` again.)

Or from the game folder:

```bash
cd game
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown (e.g. http://localhost:5173).
